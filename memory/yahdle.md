## Session log

### 2026-05-09 — Solo daily streak

Mirrored Snibble's streak pattern.

- New table `public.yahdle_solo_results` (user_id, play_date, score, completed_at) with RLS — one row per user per Atlantic-time day. Migration: `supabase/migrations/yahdle_solo_streak.sql`. Applied via Management API.
- New `src/hooks/useStreak.js` — copy of Snibble's hook, walks dates backward in Atlantic time. Streak doesn't break until midnight Atlantic passes (today empty + yesterday empty → 0).
- `SoloGamePage` upserts a row when `isGameOver` flips true (sessionStorage guard prevents repeat upserts on state changes within the same session).
- Streak badge on `SoloPlayCard`: `🔥 N` top-right, hidden when streak = 0. Same `bg-wordy-200 text-wordy-700` treatment as Snibble's lobby pet card.
- Solo-only. MP work in parallel uses separate tables.

### 2026-05-08 — Scaffolded

- Created from `rae-side-quest/templates/sq-game-starter/`
- Pre-wired with sq-ui chrome, dual-header, Supabase auth bounce,
  theme-flash prevention, push-notification SW, GitHub Pages deploy.
- Pending follow-ups before launch:
  - Add to `rae-side-quest`'s `dev:all` script
  - Add to SQ hub landing page game grid + post-login allowlist
  - Wire into shared notification system
  - Update other games' theme-flash localStorage fallback to include `yahdle-theme`
  - Build the actual game (lobby cards, board, scoring)
  - `gh repo create` + push
